# styLESS

A regularly updated version of styles.css for web projects and web apps. It requires Bootstrap and extends the basic features with Bootstrap. It is written in LESS because i am
learning to use it and also less is cleaner in compiling and preprocessing than SASS/SCSS (That's just my thinking).

Anyway, I hope its readable and usable and helps anyone out there.

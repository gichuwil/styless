/*
   An updated version of styles.css for your projects. It was built by someone who created the functionality of

   learning to use it and also less is cleaner in compiling and preprocessing than SASS/SCSS (That's just my thinking).

   Anyway, I hope its readable and usable and helps anyone out there.
